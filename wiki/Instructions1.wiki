Developers making changes to the ontology should use a change-tracking service to monitor changes to the OCRe Google code repository. 
Samson uses http://www.followthatpage.com/ to monitor http://code.google.com/p/ontology-of-clinical-research/source/browse/#svn/trunk

He gets email notifications when the source repository web page changes.

Classes, properties, and class/property restrictions will be edited consistently in Protege 4.
Protege 3.4 and Protege 4 files are not comparable as text files, thus we won't be able to reconcile conflicting versions of the ontology files if they are created by different tools.

Right now Protege 3.4 can't load the OCRe "research" module. Not sure why.

Protege 4 allows a Refactor option for extracting a subset of an ontology.

Samson is exploring the use of a tool that creates XMI (UML) files from OWL files. This tool is independent of Protege.

Action item: agree on how much detail we want/need to put into the specifications.

There are different ways to specify cardinality (e.g., making a property functional or asserting that it has maximum cardinality of 1). The OWL2UML converter may be sensitive to which we use. We need to find out.

The minimum annotation should include a textual definition of the class/property/individual. So far we've been placing such definitions in the "comment" annotation.  Alan Rector recommends that we use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/co-ode-owl-plugins/wiki/AnnotationTemplate">Annotation Template plugin</a> to make entry of annotations easier.

The Annotation Template has Label, Comment, Date and Creator: all fields should be completed when adding an annotation.
