#summary Instructions on adding definitions and source to OCRe

= Introduction =

Definitions and  source

= Details =

For each definition added (there may be more than one), specify the source. For ex., the definition of class Human_subject reads: An individual about whom an investigator conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with individual or identifiable private information. [45 CFR ยง46.102(f)]

So, source information should be an annotation on an annotation.
