# Definitions and  source #

For each definition added (there may be more than one), specify the source.
For ex., the definition of class Human\_subject reads: An individual about whom an investigator conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with individual or identifiable private information. [CFR ยง46.102(f)](45.md)

Source information should be an annotation on an annotation.

One source of definitions Simona has been using is the Glossary of Terms in The Cochrane Collaboration, available at [the Cochrane site](http://www.cochrane.org/resources/handbook/glossary.pdf).

Another is [Glossary of statistical terms](http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/index.htm) from OECD

A source used for the OCRe statistics ontology is The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics, 3rd edition, B.S. Everitt (ed), Cambridge University Press, 2006.
