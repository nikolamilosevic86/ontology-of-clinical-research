        <rdfs:label>allocation concealment method</rdfs:label>
        <rdfs:comment>Randomization is the process of randomly allocating participants into one of the arms of a controlled trial. There are two components to randomisation: the generation of a random sequence [allocation scheme], and its implementation [allocation concealment method], ideally in a way so that those entering participants into a study are not aware of the sequence (concealment of allocation). [Glossary of Terms in The Cochrane Collaboration]</rdfs:comment>
        <statistics:definition>Allocation concealment method describes the process used to ensure that the person deciding to enter a participant into a randomised controlled trial does not know the comparison group into which that individual will be allocated. This is distinct from blinding, and is aimed at preventing selection bias. Some attempts at concealing allocation are more prone to manipulation than others, and the method of allocation concealment is used as an assessment of the quality of a trial. [Glossary of Terms in The Cochrane Collaboration]

Examples:
- Centralized (e.g., allocation by a central office unaware of subject characteristics) or pharmacy-controlled.
- On-site computer system holding a locked unreadable computer file that can be accessed only after the characteristics of an enrolled participant have been entered.
- Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</statistics:definition>

        <statistics:definition>[In a controlled trial:] Blinding is the process of preventing those involved in a trial from knowing to which comparison group a particular participant belongs. The risk of bias is minimised when as few people as possible know who is receiving the experimental intervention and who the control intervention. Participants, caregivers, outcome assessors, and analysts are all candidates for being blinded. Blinding of certain groups is not always possible, for example surgeons in surgical trials. The terms single blind, double blind and triple blind are in common use, but are not used consistently and so are ambiguous unless the specific people who are blinded are listed.

        <statistics:definition>A case-crossover study is an observational study that aims to answer the question, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Was this event triggered by something unusual that happened just before?‚Äö√Ñ√π The key feature of the design is that each case serves as its own control. The method is analogous to a crossover experiment viewed retrospectively, except that the investigator does not control when a patient starts and stops being exposed to the potential trigger. Also, the exposure frequency is typically measured in only a sample of the total time when the patient was at risk of the injury or disease onset. Thus it usually resembles a case-control study more than a retrospective cohort study. 
The simplest case-crossover design is closely analogous to a traditional matched-pair case-control design. In both designs, each case has a matched control. In a traditional matched-pair case-control study, the control is a different person at a similar time. In the matched-pair case-crossover design, the control is the same person at a different time [Annu Rev Public Health. 2000;21:193-221.]</statistics:definition>

        <statistics:definition>A method of allocation used to provide comparison groups that are closely similar for several variables.
The next participant is assessed with regard to several characteristics, and assigned to the treatment group that has so far had fewer such people assigned to it. It can be done with a component of randomisation, where the chance of allocation to the group with fewer similar participants is less than one. Minimisation is best performed centrally with the aid of a computer program to ensure concealment of allocation. [Glossary of Terms in The Cochrane Collaboration]</statistics:definition>

        <statistics:definition>Restricted randomization is a random allocation scheme used to control the randomization to achieve balance between groups in size (or other characteristics). 
Different types of restricted randomization are as follows:
- Blocking: Blocking is used to ensure close balance of the numbers in each group at any time during the study. After every block the number of participants in each group would be equal. Of course blocking tends to reduce the unpredictability of randomization. Therefore it is recommended to use random block sizes when using block randomization.
- Stratification: Stratification ensures that the numbers of participants receiving each intervention are closely balanced within each stratum. Stratified randomization is achieved by performing a separate randomization procedure within each of two or more subsets of participants
- Minimization: Minimization is not a method of randomization. Indeed it is the only non-random method which is an acceptable alternative to randomization. Minimization ensures balance between intervention groups for several patient factors. Randomization lists are not set up in advance. The first patient is truly randomly allocated; for each subsequent patient, the treatment allocation is identified, which minimizes the imbalance between groups at that time.

        <statistics:definition>Equivalence is a type of comparative intent. 
An equivalence trial is designed to determine whether the response to two or more treatments differs by an amount that is clinically unimportant. This is usually demonstrated by showing that the true treatment difference is likely to lie between a lower and an upper equivalence level of clinically acceptable differences.

        <statistics:definition>Quasi-random allocation is an allocation scheme that is not random, but is intended to produce similar groups when used to allocate participants. Quasi-random methods include: allocation by the person&#39;s date of birth, by the day of the week or month of the year, by a person&#39;s medical record number, or just allocating every alternate person. In practice, these methods of allocation are relatively easy to manipulate, introducing selection bias. [Glossary of Terms in The Cochrane Collaboration]</statistics:definition>

        <statistics:curator>Simona</statistics:curator>
        <statistics:definition>Random allocation is an allocation scheme that uses the play of chance to assign participants to comparison groups in a trial, e.g. by using a random numbers table or a computer-generated random sequence. Random allocation implies that each individual or unit being entered into a trial has the same chance of receiving each of the possible interventions. It also implies that the probability that an individual will receive a particular intervention is independent of the probability that any other individual will receive the same intervention. [Glossary of Terms in The Cochrane Collaboration]</statistics:definition>
        <rdfs:comment>Randomization is the process of randomly allocating participants into one of the arms of a controlled trial. There are two components to randomisation: the generation of a random sequence [allocation scheme], and its implementation [allocation concealment method], ideally in a way so that those entering participants into a study are not aware of the sequence (concealment of allocation).

        <statistics:definition>Stratified randomization is restricted randomization used to ensure that equal numbers of participants with a characteristic thought to affect prognosis or response to the intervention will be allocated to each comparison group. For example, in a trial of women with breast cancer, it may be important to have similar numbers of pre-menopausal and postmenopausal women in each comparison group. Stratified randomisation could be used to allocate equal numbers of pre- and post-menopausal women to each treatment group. Stratified randomisation is performed by performing separate randomisation (often using random permuted blocks) for each strata.

With a significant result, one concludes in a superiority trial that E is different in effect from C, and when the observed result is in favor of E, we conclude that E is statistically, significantly better performing than C.
