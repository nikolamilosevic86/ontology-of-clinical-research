Participants, caregivers, outcome assessors, and analysts are all candidates for being blinded. Blinding of certain groups is not always possible, for example surgeons in surgical trials. The terms single blind, double blind and triple blind are in common use, but are not used consistently and so are ambiguous unless the specific people who are blinded are listed.

            >A case-crossover study is an observational study that aims to answer the question, &#8220;Was this event triggered by something unusual that happened just before?&#8221; The simple part of the question is &#8220;What happened just before?&#8221; The challenging part is to quantify &#8220;How unusual was that?&#8221; The latter question must be answered for all people in the study who experience the outcome event (disease onset, injury, or behavioral change), not just the people who had the hypothesized triggers just before... 
The key feature of the design is that each case serves as its own control. The method is analogous to a crossover experiment viewed retrospectively, except that the investigator does not control when a patient starts and stops being exposed to the potential trigger. Also, the exposure frequency is typically measured in only a sample of the total time when the patient was at risk of the injury or disease onset. Thus it usually resembles a case-control study more than a retrospective cohort study. 
The simplest case-crossover design is closely analogous to a traditional matched-pair case-control design. In both designs, each case has a matched control. In a traditional matched-pair case-control study, the control is a different person at a similar time. In the matched-pair case-crossover design, the control is the same person at a different time [adapted from: Annu Rev Public Health. 2000;21:193-221.]</statistics:definition>
