            >[In a controlled trial:] Blinding is the process of preventing those involved in a trial from knowing to which comparison group a particular participant belongs. The risk of bias is minimised when as few people as possible know who is receiving the experimental intervention and who the control intervention. Participants, caregivers, outcome assessors, and analysts are all candidates for being blinded. Blinding of certain groups is not always possible, for example surgeons in surgical trials. The terms single blind, double blind and triple blind are in common use, but are not used consistently and so are ambiguous unless the specific people who are blinded are listed.

            >A case-crossover study is an observational study that aims to answer the question, &#8220;Was this event triggered by something unusual that happened just before?&#8221; The key feature of the design is that each case serves as its own control. The method is analogous to a crossover experiment viewed retrospectively, except that the investigator does not control when a patient starts and stops being exposed to the potential trigger. Also, the exposure frequency is typically measured in only a sample of the total time when the patient was at risk of the injury or disease onset. Thus it usually resembles a case-control study more than a retrospective cohort study. 
The simplest case-crossover design is closely analogous to a traditional matched-pair case-control design. In both designs, each case has a matched control. In a traditional matched-pair case-control study, the control is a different person at a similar time. In the matched-pair case-crossover design, the control is the same person at a different time [Annu Rev Public Health. 2000;21:193-221.]</statistics:definition>

            >Restricted randomization is a random allocation scheme used to control the randomization to achieve balance between groups in size (or other characteristics). 
Different types of restricted randomization are as follows:
- Blocking: Blocking is used to ensure close balance of the numbers in each group at any time during the study. After every block the number of participants in each group would be equal. Of course blocking tends to reduce the unpredictability of randomization. Therefore it is recommended to use random block sizes when using block randomization.
- Stratification: Stratification ensures that the numbers of participants receiving each intervention are closely balanced within each stratum. Stratified randomization is achieved by performing a separate randomization procedure within each of two or more subsets of participants
- Minimization: Minimization is not a method of randomization. Indeed it is the only non-random method which is an acceptable alternative to randomization. Minimization ensures balance between intervention groups for several patient factors. Randomization lists are not set up in advance. The first patient is truly randomly allocated; for each subsequent patient, the treatment allocation is identified, which minimizes the imbalance between groups at that time.

            >Randomization is the process of randomly allocating participants into one of the arms of a controlled trial. There are two components to randomisation: the generation of a random sequence [allocation scheme], and its implementation [allocation concealment method], ideally in a way so that those entering participants into a study are not aware of the sequence (concealment of allocation). [Glossary of Terms in The Cochrane Collaboration]</rdfs:comment>
        <statistics:definition
            >Allocation concealment method describes the process used to ensure that the person deciding to enter a participant into a randomised controlled trial does not know the comparison group into which that individual will be allocated. This is distinct from blinding, and is aimed at preventing selection bias. Some attempts at concealing allocation are more prone to manipulation than others, and the method of allocation concealment is used as an assessment of the quality of a trial. [Glossary of Terms in The Cochrane Collaboration]

Examples:
- Centralized (e.g., allocation by a central office unaware of subject characteristics) or pharmacy-controlled.
- On-site computer system holding a locked unreadable computer file that can be accessed only after the characteristics of an enrolled participant have been entered.
- Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</statistics:definition>

Random allocation implies that each individual or unit being entered into a trial has the same chance of receiving each of the possible interventions. It also implies that the probability that an individual will receive a particular intervention is independent of the probability that any other individual will receive the same intervention.

Each Epoch serves a purpose in the trial as a whole, typically exposing the subject to a treatment or preparing them for a treatment, or gathering post-treatment data.  Epoch-specific (state) transition rules control the subject&#39;s movement from one Epoch to another.

For example, a study designed to assess the effects of treatments might have 3 epochs, a Screening epoch in which subjects&#39; eligibility is determined and baseline measurements are made, a Treatment epoch during which treatments are given and effects of treatment are assessed, and a Follow-up epoch during which post-treatment assessments are conducted.  

NOTE: A subject moves from one Epoch to another and can only be in one epoch at a time. The subject can only move to an Epoch with a greater sequenceNumber. The main purpose of the Epoch is to organize the Arms for comparison purposes. Activities in the same Epoch but a different Arm need not be similar in time and pattern.

When the aim of the study is to show that an experimental (E) treatment is superior to a control (C) treatment, the RCT is called a superiority trial and the associated statistical test is a superiority test. With a significant result, one concludes in a superiority trial that E is different in effect from C, and when the observed result is in favor of E, we conclude that E is statistically, significantly better performing than C.

            >A systematic review is a non individual-human study that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyse data from the studies that are included in the review. Statistical methods (meta-analysis) may or may not be used to analyse and summarise the results of the included studies. [adapted from: Glossary of Terms in The Cochrane Collaboration]

Meta-analysis is the use of statistical techniques in a systematic review to integrate the summary results of included studies. Sometimes misused as a synonym for systematic reviews, where the review includes a meta-analysis. [adapted from: Glossary of Terms in The Cochrane Collaboration]</statistics:definition>
