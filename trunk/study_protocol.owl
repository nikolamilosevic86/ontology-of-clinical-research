The main purpose of the Epoch is to organize the Arms for comparison purposes. Activities in the same Epoch but a different Arm need not be similar in time and pattern.  

Each Epoch serves a purpose in the trial as a whole, typically exposing the subject to a treatment or preparing them for a treatment, or gathering post-treatment data.  Epoch-specific (state) transition rules control the subject&#39;s movement from one Epoch to another.

For example, a study designed to assess the effects of treatments might have 3 epochs, a Screening epoch in which subjects&#39; eligibility is determined and baseline measurements are made, a Treatment epoch during which treatments are given and effects of treatment are assessed, and a Follow-up epoch during which post-treatment assessments are conducted.

1). StudyProtocol is a sub-class of the Document class:
StudyProtocol is a sub-class of Document and, as such, inherits all of the basic characteristics of its parent.  In particular, an instance can contain all of the definitions, specifications, and content of the various (logical) documents which collectively define a study, including (but not limited to) documents that describe the objective(s), background, and/or plan (including the design, methodology, statistical considerations, organization, or other supplemental materials that describe the required information of a Study.
2). StudyProtocol is a collector for Document instances:
StudyProtocol is a collector for all various artifacts (including the protocol itself) which collectively define a study, including (but not limited to) specifications of planned, scheduled, or performed Activities, ObservationResults, Assessments, Analyses and their various inter-relationships.

NOTE:  A StudyProtocol can be either Primary or Correlative.  A StudyProtocol is considered to be Primary if it has one or more Correlative studies associated with it.  A Correlative study extends the objectives or observations/conclusions of a Primary study, enrolling the same (or a subset of the same) subjects as were enrolled in the Primary study. (Correlative Studies are not modeled in BRIDG yet.)

NOTE: We are assuming that a document is a container, which may be physical or logical, with the six characteristics listed in the definition of the Document class.  This class is the container for the Plan. 

NOTE: StudyProtocol describes the pre-study, study, and post-study portions of the plan. [BRIDG Release 2.2]</rdfs:comment>
